Are there data points that don't make sense? (Errors in data entry can be spotted this way.) And especially, you want to get a _visual_ representation of how data are distributed in your sample.\n",

We experimented with `beers_clean.groupby('style').mean()` and were amazedâ¦ However, one thing was bothersome: `pandas` computed the mean (by style) of every column, including the `id` and `brewery_id`, which have no business being averaged. So we decided to first drop the columns we don't need, leaving only `abv`, `ibu` and `style`.
