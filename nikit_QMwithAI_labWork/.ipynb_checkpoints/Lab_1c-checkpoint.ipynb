    "\n",
    "Imagine you had a square that had side length of 2a units; as you know, the area of that square would be (length * height) = (2a X 2a) = $(2a)^2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that you had a circle of radius *a*, hopefully it is obvious that this circle would fit perfectly within that square. You don't know the actual value of $\\pi$ but you do know that the area of such a circle can be estimated using the forumla area_of_circle = $\\pi r^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully it is clear, with a little bit of manipulation, that the ratio of the areas of the circle and the square that it is inscribed within is given by $\\pi a^2/(2a)^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you threw a bunch of 'random darts' at a board that was bounded by the square (i.e. each dart has an equal chance of falling anywhere within the square) then by counting the number of darts that fell within the circle and comparing that to the total number of darts thrown, you would have the same proportion as you just described above. If you did this with enough darts, then using these two proportions you could get an estimate of $\\pi$.\n"
