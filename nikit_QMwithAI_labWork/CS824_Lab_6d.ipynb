    "# Using matrices to transform vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few 'standard' transformations that are illustrated below for the 2-D case - i.e. vectors in (i, j) space operated on by a {2 x 2} matrix. You can try these transformatons out with vectors of your choosing.  Probably the best way to appreciate the effect of each transformation would be to view these graphically, but as you saw in an earlier section of this lab I have not yet found a quick / easy way in Python to do this - so if you find one **please** share it with the class on the *forum*...\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some good resources on-line that let you explore some of this. By far the best on-line material I have found is the *3Blue1Brown* set of videos from Grant Sanderson. I have suggested a couple of those as part of this week's mini-lectures, but his whole series on the **Essence of linear algebra** (all 15 parts!) will be well worth putting aside to watch at some point if some of this still feels like 'magic' to you (hint: it's not!). \n",
    "\n",
    "As noted on *MyPlace*, in the context of this lab the 3rd video in that series [Linear Transformations and Matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=3), is of particular relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could watch segments, then pause the video and see whether you can replicate some of the operations in Python - though the nice visualisations that Grant generates often makes it more intuitive just to watch those.\n"
